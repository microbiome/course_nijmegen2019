# Hands-on 2

## Key concepts: core, diversity, community variation
 
Next, let us familiarize with ecological concepts and methods for
analysing microbiome profiling data.


 * **Core microbiota** Pick up the core microbiota including taxa that
     exceed 0.1% relative abundance in over 50% of the samples
     (prevalence). How many core taxa there are? You can read more about the core microbiota definition in [Salonen et al. 2012](https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(14)60962-9/fulltext)

 * Visualize the core microbiota ([examples](https://microbiome.github.io/tutorials/Core.html))

 * **Alpha diversity** Estimate taxonomic diversity for each sample
     (function microbiome::alpha). Compare the results between two or more
     diversity indices.

 * **Beta diversity** Visualize community variation with PCoA ([examples](https://microbiome.github.io/tutorials/Ordination.html))



## Special properties of microbiome data

 * Sparsity, compositionality, non-Gaussianity
 * The role of covariates: age, diet, or medication 
 * Influence on statistical analysis
 * Differential abundance analysis: DADA2
 * Co-occurrence networks: SparCC
