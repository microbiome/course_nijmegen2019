Learning goals Introduce microbial community data analysis. There will be talks and discussion on theory and methodology for analysis of microbial community data. We will cover topics ranging from design of studies, sequencing technologies, importance of controls and standardized DNA processing. Supervised hands-on training covering analyses from raw reads using NG-Tax, downstream analysis in R for exploration and analysis of microbiome sequencing data will be priority. There will be a strong focus on using R, R Studio for moving towards reproducible and open science. Target audience Anyone who plans to or is currently doing high throughput microbial community analysis. Venue This course will be held at Radboud University, Nijmegen on Sep 12-13, 2019, organised in collaboration with University of Turku, Finland. 1.1 Preparation 1.1.1 Software setup We recommend using your own laptop. If this is not possible, kindly contact the organizers. Install the following software before the course: R Download link. Rstudio Download link. R Libraries Installation script Some installation instructions can be also found in the Data Carpentry manual Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists. 1.2 Reusing the material Unless otherwise stated, the teaching materials can be freely used, modified and shared based on the open 2-Clause BSD License.

More importantly on how to look at your data and filter appropriately. We will use the Human microbiome project phase I data. OTU or ASVs or sOTUs For past few years (maybe decade), identifying Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from raw sequences used clustering approach. Using 97% identity cut-off was a standard approach and often closed reference OTU picking was accepted in the sicentific community. During the time of the development of tools and bioinformatics approaches this was possibly the best available method. However, as with many other fields of science, the knowledge has been updated. Evolution of bioinformatics approaches is a constant process. Based on current knowledge, the cons of 97% OTU picking stratergy (using clustering approaches) have out-weighed the pros (eg. less time). Recent approaches are now focused towards Amplicon Seuence Variants/sOTUs: * Oligotyping * Deblur * DADA2 * NG-Tax All above approaches have one common theme, they avoid 97% clustering and focus on minor differences (in many cases single nucleotide variations) to identify unique ASVs/sOTU. Note: Some how naming is different and variable. For this purpose and in this book, I will stick to ASVs when data from NG-tax is used. In this, section, we will compare outputs from 97% OTU picking approach and NG-tax approach. The data used here is the 16S rRNA gene variable region (V1-V3) for 97% OTU-pciking. The raw reads were processed using QIIME 1.9.1, SortMeRNA, and OTU picking was done using the closed-reference OTU-picking at 97% identity. For NG-Tax, we use the same raw data and processed through default settings. Here, we do not aim to bench mark. For this course, we aim to show differences between results from two approaches. For down stream analysis of *.biom files we use Phyloseq and microbiome. Kindly cite all the packages and tools that were used in your analysis as listed at the end of each document in sessionInfo. Also make sure that you provide the workflow and scripts you used for analysis atleast as supplementary material with your research article. Check Quick-R. Structure Let us create few folders to organize the analysis. While this can be personal preference, make sure you write the structure to guide others who do not know your data well. # Create Folders as following # Tables dir.create(&quot;tables&quot;) # Figures dir.create(&quot;figures&quot;) # Phyloseq objects dir.create(&quot;phyobjects&quot;) # Custom codes/notes dir.create(&quot;codes_notes&quot;) Load packages library(microbiome) # data analysis and visualisation library(phyloseq) # also the basis of data object. Data analysis and visualisation library(microbiomeutilities) # some utility tools library(RColorBrewer) # nice color options library(ggpubr) # publication quality figures, based on ggplot2 library(DT) # interactive tables in html and markdown library(data.table) # alternative to data.frame library(dplyr) # data handling Making a phyloseq object This is the basis for the analyses demonstrated in this tutorial. In the phyloseq object, information on OTU abundances, taxonomy of OTUs, the phylogenetic tree and metadata is stored. A single object with all this information provides a convinient way of handling, manipulating and visualizing data. For more infromation: phyloseq Please remember that the metadata (i.e. mapping) file has to be in .csv format (columns have sample attributes). The read_phylseq function from microbiome package requires metadata in .csv format. The read_phyloseq function can be used for reading other outputs (like .shared and consensus taxonomy files from mothur) into phyloseq object. type ?read_phyloseq in the console pane for more information. 4.2 Key concepts: core, diversity, landscape view 4.3 Reproducible reporting with Rmarkdown "],
