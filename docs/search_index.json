Target audience Advanced students and applied researchers who wish to develop their skills in microbial community analysis. Venue Radboud University, Nijmegen. Sep 12-13, 2019, organised in collaboration with University of Turku, Finland. Learning goals The students will become familiar with standard bioinformatics concepts and methods in taxonomic profiling studies of the human microbiome. This includes better understanding of the specific statistical challenges, practical hands-on experience with the commonly used methods, and reproducible research with R.

Solve the exercises by taking advantage of the online examples and resources that are pointed out in the study material. There is often more than one way to solve a given task. Do not hesitate to ask support from the course assistants. 3.1 Reproducible reporting with Rmarkdown Reproducible reporting is the starting point for reporting. Perform the following tasks: Create a Rmarkdown template in RStudio, and render it into a document (markdown, PDF, docx or other format) Experiment with different options with Rmarkdown 3.2 From raw data to phyloseq objects Next, let us investigate in more detail how taxonomic profiling data is organized in R. The data structure is called phyloseq (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). In this course, we focus on downstream analysis of taxonomic profiling data, and assume that the data has already been appropriately preprocessed and converted in the phyloseq format. The exact steps vary based on the 16S profiling platform. Hands-on examples for converting the Illumina MiSeq sequencing data into R phyloseq object can be found from Bioconductor Workflow for Microbiome Data Analysis: from raw reads to community analyses (Callahan et al. F1000, 2016). Provide the answers to at least some of the following questions in the form of a reproducible report (with Rmarkdown). Include the code that you use to retrieve the results. We will release code that provides solutions to all exercises. Load example data of the gut microbiome profiling of 1006 western adults from microbiome R package. The example data sets are already in the phyloseq format. R provides many readily available tools to handle and analyze taxonomic profiling data that is provided in this format. Microbal abundances retrieve the microbial (OTU) abundance table from the example data set (phyloseq object). Note that in this example data set we have genus abundances instead of OTU abundances. This example data set is based on the HITChip 16S phylogenetic microarray, and the taxonomic groupings are only approximations to exact genus-level taxonomic classifications. How many different genus-level groups this phyloseq object has? How many different samples this phyloseq object has? Retrieve the taxonomy table from the phyloseq object and print out the first few lines of it with the R command head(). How many different phylum-level groups this phyloseq object has? Tip: count the unique entries in the Phylum column of the taxonomic table. Retrieve sample metadata from the example phyloseq object What is the male/femal ratio in this data set? Draw a histogram of subject ages Do some subjects have multiple samples? Subsetting Pick a subset of the phyloseq object including only obese individuals. How many there are? How many obese males who are over 40 years old there are? What is the maximum abundance of Akkermansia in this data set? Transformations The phyloseq data has absolute abundances. Use the microbiome::transform command to convert these into relative abundances. Compare Akkermansia abundance using the example data before and after the compositionality transformation (with a cross-plot, for instance). Draw a histogram of library sizes (total number of reads per sample). You can use the readcount function, or count the sum of reads per sample by using the colSums command applied on the otu table abundances. The example data set is from phylogenetic microarray, hence the numbers correspond to light intensity on the array rather than sequencing reads but the interpretation is analogous and we can ignore this detail for demonstration purposes. The key idea is that different samples may have different bacterial load. Check Vandeputte et al. 2017 for further discussion on the differences between absolute and relative quantification of microbial abundances. If time allows, experiment with other phyloseq data manipulation tools "],

Core microbiota Pick up the core microbiota including taxa that exceed 0.1% relative abundance in over 50% of the samples (prevalence). How many core taxa there are? You can read more about the core microbiota definition in Salonen et al. 2012 Visualize the core microbiota (examples) Alpha diversity Estimate taxonomic diversity for each sample (function microbiome::alpha). Compare the results between two or more diversity indices. Beta diversity Visualize community variation with PCoA (examples) 4.2 Special properties of microbiome data Sparsity, compositionality, non-Gaussianity The role of covariates: age, diet, or medication Influence on statistical analysis Differential abundance analysis: DADA2 Co-occurrence networks: SparCC "],
