Solve the exercises by taking advantage of the online examples and resources that are pointed out in the study material. There is often more than one way to solve a given task. It is assumed that you have already installed the required software. Do not hesitate to ask support from the course assistants. 3.1 Part I: Reproducible reporting with Rmarkdown Reproducible reporting is the starting point for reporting. Perform the following tasks: Create a Rmarkdown template in RStudio, and render it into a document (markdown, PDF, docx or other format) Experiment with different options with Rmarkdown If you are new to Rmarkdown, Rstudio provides ressources to learn reporting using Rmarkdown. 3.2 Part II: Phyloseq data structure Next, let us investigate in more detail how taxonomic profiling data is organized in R. The data structure is called phyloseq (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). In this course, we focus on downstream analysis of taxonomic profiling data, and assume that the data has already been appropriately preprocessed and converted in the phyloseq format. The exact steps vary based on the 16S profiling platform. Hands-on examples for converting the Illumina MiSeq sequencing data into R phyloseq object can be found from Bioconductor Workflow for Microbiome Data Analysis: from raw reads to community analyses (Callahan et al. F1000, 2016). Provide the answers to at least some of the following questions in the form of a reproducible report (with Rmarkdown). Include the code that you use to retrieve the results. We will release code that provides solutions to all exercises. Load example data of the two-week diet swap study between western (USA) and traditional (rural Africa) diets from microbiome R package. The example data sets are already in the phyloseq format. R provides many readily available tools to handle and analyze taxonomic profiling data that is provided in this format. Microbal abundances / OTU Table retrieve the microbial (OTU) abundance table from the example data set (phyloseq object). This example data set has abundances at the genus level instead of OTU level.c Tip: microbiome::abundances or phyloseq::otu_table OTU tables Retrieve the OTU table and investigate: 1) How many different samples and genus-level groups this phyloseq object has? What is the maximum abundance of Akkermansia in this data set? Tips: see data operations in the microbiome tutorial Draw a histogram of library sizes (total number of reads per sample). You can use the readcount function, or count the sum of reads per sample by using the colSums command applied on the otu table abundances. The example data set is from phylogenetic microarray, hence the numbers correspond to light intensity on the array rather than sequencing reads but the interpretation is analogous and we can ignore this detail for demonstration purposes. The key idea is that different samples may have different bacterial load. Check Vandeputte et al. 2017 for further discussion on the differences between absolute and relative quantification of microbial abundances. Taxonomy table Retrieve the taxonomy table and print out the first few lines of it with the R command head(). Investigate how many different phylum-level groups this phyloseq object has? Tips: phyloseq::tax_table and unique. Sample metadata Retrieve sample metadata. How many unique subjects this data set has? What is the male/female ratio? Draw a histogram of subject ages. Tips: microbiome::meta 3.3 Part III: Data manipulation and exploration Subsetting Pick a subset of the phyloseq object including only male and obese individuals. How many there are? Tips: subset_samples Transformations The phyloseq data has absolute abundances. Use the microbiome::transform command to convert these into relative abundances. Compare Akkermansia abundance using the example data before and after the compositionality transformation (with a cross-plot, for instance). Finally, compare the results to CLR- transformed data (see e.g. Gloor et al. 2017) Visual exploration Visualize the population distribution of abundances for the following taxa: Akkermansia, Dialister, Gemella. Do the same for CLR-transformed abundances. Tip: microbiome::plot_density / microbiome::transform Experiment with other phyloseq data manipulation tools "],
["hands-on-2-key-concepts-and-techniques.html", "4 Hands-on 2: Key concepts and techniques 4.1 Part I: Key concepts 4.2 Part II: Statistical testing", " 4 Hands-on 2: Key concepts and techniques This session will let us familiarize with ecological concepts and methods for analysing microbiome profiling data. 4.1 Part I: Key concepts Prepare a reproducible report and address the following questions. Alpha diversity Estimate taxonomic diversity for each sample (function microbiome::alpha). Compare the results between two or more diversity indices (visually or statistically). See microbiome tutorial for examples. Beta diversity Visualize community variation with PCoA (examples). Investigate the influence of the data transformations on statistical analysis: Visualize community variation with PCoA with the following options: 1) Bray-Curtis distances for compositional data; 2) Euclidean distances for CLR-transformed data. Prevalence What is the most prevalent genus in the data (tip: microbiome::prevalence and sort) Core microbiota Pick up the core microbiota including taxa that exceed 0.1% relative abundance in over 50% of the samples (prevalence). How many core taxa there are? You can read more about the core microbiota definition in Salonen et al. 2012. Visualize the core microbiota by following the available examples. 4.2 Part II: Statistical testing Community-level comparisons Use PERMANOVA to investigate whether the community composition differs between two groups of individuals (e.g. males and females, or some other grouping of your choice). You can also include covariates such as age and gender, and see how this affects the results. OTU-level comparisons Use DESeq2 to identify which genera are associated with gender differences (examples on DESeq2). For more explanation on the method, see DESeq2 R/Bioconductor. Role of covariates Note that including key covariates (diet, medication, age..) may have remarkable influence on data interpretation in the above analyses (Falony et al. Science 2016) Experiment with the other available tools in the microbiome tutorial Provide a compact summary of the data and analyses in the form of a reproducible Rmarkdown report. Include only selected summaries and analyses of your choice, and focus on delivering a clear and compact report. "],
