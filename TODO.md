# TODO


 * Check if there is something to add from the course announcement (in
   the learning goals etc)

 * Add links to Radboud / course announcements / your own contact info
   for support / etc. where appropriate

 * Add or improve the material as needed

 * Consider further questions to the hands-on sessions

 * Prepare model solutions to the hands-on session questions; as
   reproducible scripts that can be run through as is. This will also
   help to test dependencies.

 * Add the necessary dependencies to code/install_dependencies.R

 * Check that all links work

 * Consider if you are willing to lead one of the hands-on sessions
   (with my help); and then we can switch for the other one?
