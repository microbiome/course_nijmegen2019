# TODO

In a rough order of priority.

 * Add the necessary dependencies to code/install_dependencies.R

 * Check that all links work

 * Add links to Radboud / course announcements / your own contact info
   for support / etc. where appropriate

 * Consider changeing the example data set from atlas1006 to
   dietswap. The latter might be more similar to typical case studies
   encoutntered by the course participants.

 * Add tips and links to useful examples and material and tips
   throughout to the handson exercise questions. This will help the
   students to find the necessary examples and code easily. Some of
   the R links in the study material might better go to the actual
   hands-on instructions?

 * Consider if you are willing to lead one of the hands-on sessions
   (with my help); and then we can switch for the other one?

 * Prepare model solutions to the hands-on session questions; as
   reproducible scripts that can be run through as is. This will also
   help to test dependencies.

 * Update the literature and links in the study material section?

 * Check if there is something to add from the official course
   announcement (in the learning goals etc)

 * Note that we can also modify the microbiome R package tutorials
   directly if necessary.
