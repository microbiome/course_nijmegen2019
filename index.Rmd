# Overview

This course provides an overview of the standard bioinformatics workflow in taxonomic profiling studies, ranging from data preprocessing to statistical analysis and reproducible reporting, with a focus on examples from human gut microbiota studies.

**Target audience** Advanced students and applied researchers who wish to develop their skills in microbial community analysis.

**Venue** [Radboud University](), Nijmegen. Sep 12-13, 2019, organised in collaboration with [University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en/university/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/department-of-future-technologies), Finland. 

**Learning goals** The students will become familiar with standard bioinformatics concepts and methods in taxonomic profiling studies of the human microbiome. This includes better understanding of the specific statistical challenges, practical hands-on experience with the commonly used methods, and reproducible research with R. After the course the students know how to approach new programming tasks by utilizing available documentation and R tools.

## Preparing for the course


### Software setup

We recommend using your own laptop. If this is not possible, kindly contact the organizers.

Install the following software before the course:

* R [Download link](https://cran.r-project.org)
* Rstudio [Download link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* R Libraries [Installation script](code/install_dependencies.R)

If you are not familiar with R programming, we highly recommend going through [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/) by Data Carpentry and further links to R resources in the [study material](https://microbiome.github.io/course_nijmegen2019/study-material.html).
