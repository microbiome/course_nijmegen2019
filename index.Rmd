# Overview

The course provides an overview of the standard bioinformatics workflow in taxonomic profiling studies, with a focus on human gut microbiota, ranging from data preprocessing to statistical analysis and reproducible reporting.

**Learning goals** Introduce microbial community data analysis. There will be talks and discussion on theory and methodology for analysis of microbial community data. We will cover topics ranging from design of studies, sequencing technologies, importance of controls and standardized DNA processing. Supervised hands-on training covering analyses from raw reads using NG-Tax, downstream analysis in R for exploration and analysis of microbiome sequencing data will be priority. There will be a strong focus on using R, R Studio for moving towards reproducible and open science.   

**Target audience** Anyone who plans to or is currently doing high throughput microbial community analysis.  

**Venue** This course will be held at [Radboud University](), Nijmegen on Sep 12-13, 2019, organised in collaboration with [University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en/university/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/department-of-future-technologies), Finland. 


## Preparation


### Software setup

We recommend using your own laptop. If this is not possible, kindly contact the organizers.

Install the following software before the course:

* R [Download link](https://cran.r-project.org).    
* Rstudio [Download link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).  
* R Libraries [Installation script](code/install_dependencies.R)

Some installation instructions can be also found in the Data Carpentry manual [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/).
